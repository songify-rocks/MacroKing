# Macro King

A macro tool for multiple keyboards

## REQUIREMENTS

This project relies on Interception, a custom driver written by Francisco Lopes. You can read about it [here](http://www.oblita.com/interception) and download it [here](https://github.com/oblitum/Interception/releases/tag/v1.0.1).

**YOU WILL NEED THIS DRIVER FOR MACRO KING**. Without it the application won't work. Installation instructions are listed on [their website](http://www.oblita.com/interception).

## Use Cases

This is designed to be a poor mans StreamDeck. Plug in any extra keyboard and use it for hotkeys! It ~~has~~ will have integration for YouTube and Twitch livestreams, but you'll be able to use it as a regular hotkey or macro tool.

## Inspiration

This tool is inspired by [Taran van Hemert](https://twitter.com/TaranVH), one of the primary video editors for Linus Tech Tips. They use **so many** keyboards for editing videos, it's kind of mad. But yeah, this is a tool for multi-keyboard users.
